## Compiling

Compiling is only currently supported on unix based OS's (ex: Linux, Mac).
Targetting Windows is possible by using MinGW.

`make` for linux
`make windows` for windows

## Development

Development is currently *halted* in favor of other projects.
If I ever have the motivation to pick this up again then development may resume at a later time.
